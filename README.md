# Training Data

The following represent images for use in training a farm animal image classification machine learning model. The images are split into testing, validation and training folders using the 70/30 split rule. The images are intended for use with CreateML which is an Xcode tool used for creating CoreML machine learning models. 

The images were originally obtained from the [Animals-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10) dataset.
